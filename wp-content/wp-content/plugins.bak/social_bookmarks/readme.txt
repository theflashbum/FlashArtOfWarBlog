The Social Bookmarks plugin for WordPress adds a list of XHTML compliant graphic links at the end 
of your posts and/or pages that allow your visitors to easily submit them in a number of social 
bookmarking sites.
Furthermore, the plugin adds a page in the WordPress admin section that lets you customize it. 
See the Customization section below for details.

== New Features in version 4.0 ==

* Added Support for WordPress versions greater than 2.1.x
* Added AJAX interface (can be enabled, disabled from the Options Page in the Dashboard).
* Fixed the problem where the images where not loaded if the plugin directory was named as social-bookmarks
* Fixed the spacing issue that was caused with the use of some Themes.
* Complete re-write of the plugin code
* Localization support. Additional language packs can be placed on the plugin directory that add language specific social sites.
* Loads of new sites are included in the international English pack.

== Customization ==

The Options page in the WordPress admin section allows you to customize the plugin. The plugin bundles the English social sites but additional language packs can be downloaded from dountsis.com. Furthermore, a language pack template is available, in case you want to create your custom language pack. If you do, I would be more than happy to make it available on dountsis.com so that there is a common repository with all the language packs (of course you will take all the credits that you rightfully deserve!).

== Installation ==

1. Upload the contents of the social_bookmarks directory to wp-content/plugins/social_bookmarks directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is it possible to include site XXXXX to a language pack? =

Sure! just mail me the link and a logo and I will include it in the next revision of the relevant language pack.

= Do I have to wait for another plugin release to get an updated list of sites? =

The releases of the language packs are independent of the plug-in core releases.


I hope that you enjoy the plugin,
