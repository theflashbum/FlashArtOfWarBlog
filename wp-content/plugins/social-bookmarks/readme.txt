== Description ==
The Social Bookmarks plugin for WordPress adds a list of XHTML compliant graphic links at the end of your posts and/or pages that allow your visitors to easily submit them to a number of social bookmarking sites. 

Furthermore, the plugin adds a section in the WordPress Dashboard that lets you customize it. You can enable/disable social bookmarking sites and exclude specific pages from the plugin.

== Customization ==

The Options page in the WordPress Dashboard allows you to customize the plugin. 

The plugin bundles the English social sites but additional Site Packs can be downloaded from [Social Bookmarks Site Packs](http://www.dountsis.com/downloads?cat=2 "Sites Packs at Dountsis.com") repository.

Furthermore, a Template Site pack is available, in case you want to create your custom Site Pack. If you do, I would be more than happy to make it available on [Social Bookmarks Site Packs](http://www.dountsis.com/downloads?cat=2 "Sites Packs at Dountsis.com") repository so that there is a common place with all the Site Packs (of course you will take all the credits that you rightfully deserve!).


== Installation ==

It is highly recommended to use the automatic installation/updating feature of WordPress. For a manual installation, please follow the instructions below:
1. Upload the contents of the social-bookmarks directory to wp-content/plugins/social-bookmarks directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
